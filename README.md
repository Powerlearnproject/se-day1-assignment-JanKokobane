#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 

Software engineering is the brand of computer science that deals with the maintaining of software’s applications, developing, testing, deployment, design of software’s and also systematically applies engineering principle.
Software engineering plays a crucial role in shaping our digital world by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life. E.g. healthcare, commerce and entertainment. It also insures that software systems are robust, efficient, secure and capable of evolving the need of users and businesses. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1)	Structured Programming 
Introduced principles like control structures and top-down design to enhance code clarity and maintainability.
2)	Agile Movement
Emphasized iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility in response to changing requirements.
3)	DevOps
Integrated development and operations through automation and continuous integration/deployment.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning 
Define the project scope, requirement and objectives. Analysing stakeholder’s exception and needs.
Analysis 
Involves detailed examination of user needs and requirements. Analysts work to understand what the software should do and document these requirements.
Design
Translates requirements into a blueprint for the system. This includes architectural design, data models, and user interface design.
Development
The actual coding of the software takes place in this phase. Developers write and compile code based on the design specifications.
Testing
Involves systematically checking the software for defects and verifying that it meets the requirements. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
Deployment
The software is released to the end users or into a production environment. This phase may involve installation, configuration, and initial training.
Maintenance
Ongoing support and updates are provided to address any issues that arise after deployment. This phase also includes making enhancements and fixing bugs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Waterfall Methodology 
Linear and Sequential: Each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance) is completed one after the other.
Documentation-Heavy: Emphasizes comprehensive documentation before moving to the next phase.
Fixed Scope: Requirements are defined upfront and changes are difficult to accommodate once development begins.

Agile Methodology 
Iterative and Incremental: Development occurs in small, iterative cycles (sprints) with regular feedback and adjustments.
Flexible and Adaptive: Embraces changes in requirements and ongoing feedback from stakeholders.
Collaborative: Promotes close collaboration between developers, stakeholders, and end users throughout the project.

Waterfall Scenarios:
Building a bridge: Clear specifications, predictable timeline and large team.
Developing a database management system: Stable requirements, high accuracy required.

Agile Scenarios:
Creating a new mobile app: Evolving requirements, constant user feedback.
Implementing a customer relationship management (CRM) system: Dynamic customer needs, iterative improvement.

Comparison 
Waterfall and Agile are two distinct project management methodologies with different approaches. Waterfall is a linear, sequential process that works best for projects with well-defined, stable requirements, offering predictability but limited flexibility. In contrast, Agile is iterative and flexible, breaking projects into small sprints that allow for continuous feedback and adaptation to changing requirements. Waterfall is ideal for structured environments, while Agile excels in dynamic settings where adaptability is crucial.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer roles and responsibilities
-Designs, codes, and tests software according to requirements specifications
-Implements software features and bug fixes
-Collaborates with other developers to ensure code quality and adherence to standards
-Estimates development effort and tracks progress
-May specialize in specific programming languages, technologies, or application domains
 
Quality Assurance Engineer roles and responsibilities
-Testing: Quality Assurance Engineers are responsible for testing the software to identify any defects or issues before the product is released. They perform various types of testing, such as functional, regression, performance, and security testing.
-Test Plan Development: They create detailed test plans, test cases, and test scripts based on the software requirements and specifications.
-Automation: Quality Assurance Engineers often develop and maintain automated test scripts to streamline the testing process and ensure consistency in test execution.
-Reporting and Documentation: They document and report bugs, working closely with developers to ensure issues are resolved. QA Engineers also ensure that the software meets quality standards and complies with any regulatory requirements.

Project Manager Roles and responsibilities
-Planning and Scheduling: The Project Manager oversees the entire project lifecycle, from initial planning to final delivery. They develop project plans, define milestones, and create schedules to ensure timely delivery.
-Resource Management: They allocate resources, including personnel, budget, and time, to various tasks and ensure that the project stays within its constraints.
-Risk Management: Project Managers identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies to address them. They monitor progress and adjust plans as needed to address any issues that arise.
-Communication: They serve as the primary point of contact between stakeholders (including clients, team members, and upper management) and ensure clear communication of project goals, progress, and any changes.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

The importance of Integrated Development Environments is to provide a comprehensive and consolidated platform for software development, offering numerous benefits:
Enhanced Productivity: IDEs streamline the development process by providing a cohesive workspace that includes editing, debugging, code completion, and navigation tools, reducing the time spent on repetitive tasks.
Improved Debugging: IDEs offer robust debugging capabilities, allowing developers to identify and fix errors efficiently. They provide step-by-step code execution visualization, breakpoints, and interactive debugging consoles.
Code Reusability: IDEs facilitate code reusability by allowing developers to create and manage code libraries, templates, and snippets. This reduces the need for manually copying and pasting code, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
Code Refactoring: IDEs support code refactoring features that enable developers to safely modify existing code while preserving its functionality. This helps improve code structure, readability, and maintainability.
Integrated Testing: IDEs often incorporate testing frameworks, allowing developers to write and run tests alongside the code. This enables continuous testing during development, reducing the risk of bugs and improving code quality.

The importance of Version Control Systems are essential for managing and tracking changes to code over time. They provide the following advantages:
Collaboration: VCS facilitate collaboration among multiple developers by providing a central repository for code storage and version management. It eliminates version conflicts and ensures that all team members are working on the latest version of the code.
History and Rollback: VCS maintains a complete history of all changes made to the codebase, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if a bug is introduced or if the current approach needs to be reconsidered.
Change Tracking: VCS tracks changes to specific lines of code, making it easy to identify the author and timestamp of each modification. This is crucial for auditing and understanding code changes.
Branching and Merging: VCS allows developers to create branches for different features or bug fixes. Branches can be merged back into the main branch when development is complete, ensuring seamless integration of changes.
Code Recovery: In case of accidental file deletions or system crashes, VCS provides a backup of the code, allowing developers to recover lost work and avoid data loss.

Examples of IDEs and VCSs
IDEs:						                    VCSs:
Visual Studio Code (VSCode)			    Git
IntelliJ IDEA					              Subversion (SVN)
Eclipse						                  Mercurial (Hg)
PyCharm					                    Perforce Helix Core (P4)


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Software engineers face a range of challenges that can make their work both demanding and complex. Here are some of the most common issues they encounter, along with strategies to tackle them effectively

-Complex Code: Break it down, use design patterns, and review code regularly.
-Changing Requirements: Use Agile, communicate well, and prioritize key features.
-Time Management: Prioritize tasks, time box, and automate repetitive work.
-Debugging: Use tools, log issues, and isolate problems.
-Staying Current: Keep learning, join communities, and experiment with new tools.
-Code Quality: Follow best practices, automate tests, and refactor often.
-Team Collaboration: Communicate clearly, pair program, and use collaboration tools.
-Technical Debt: Regularly clean up code, focus on critical areas, and balance new work with debt reduction.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

In software quality assurance, different types of testing are employed to ensure the quality of software systems at various levels. These types include
1. Unit Testing
-Helps identify issues in the early stages of development.
-Ensures the correctness and reliability of individual components.
-Typically performed by developers during the early stages of development.
Importance:
-Prevents errors from being propagated to higher levels.
-Isolates and identifies bugs early on, reducing the time and effort required for debugging.
-Promotes code maintainability and reusability
 
2. Integration Testing
-Tests the interaction and functionality of multiple units of code that have been integrated together.
-Verifies that the components work correctly when combined.
-Typically performed after unit testing.
Importance:
-Verifies that different parts of the application communicate and function together properly.
-Identifies issues in the way components interact, which might not be apparent in unit tests.
-Ensures that integrated components work together without causing unexpected problems.

3. System Testing
-Tests the complete software system as a whole, including its interactions with external systems.
-Evaluates the system's functionality, performance, and usability from a user's perspective.
-Typically performed before deployment.
Importance:
-Ensures that the entire system functions correctly in a production-like environment.
-Confirms that the software meets all the specified requirements and performs as intended.
-Identifies issues related to the system's behaviour and performance, including user interactions and usability.

4. Acceptance Testing
-Acceptance testing determines whether the software meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for release. It is often performed by the end-users or QA team to ensure that the software satisfies their needs and expectations.
Importance:
-Provides assurance to stakeholders that the system meets their expectations.
-Identifies any remaining issues that may not have been uncovered in previous testing phases.
-Facilitates the smooth implementation and adoption of the software system.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting the right input to get the best output from AI models. It’s crucial because how you structure your prompt directly affects how effectively the AI understands and responds. Whether you're looking for a technical explanation, creative story, or specific task, the way you frame your prompt can significantly impact the results.

The importance of interacting with AI models 
-Better Results: A well-crafted prompt leads to more accurate and relevant AI responses.
-Clarity: Clear prompts prevent misunderstandings, especially with complex topics.
-Tailored Outputs: Different prompts for different needs—be it code, content, or conversation.
-Creative Exploration: Experimenting with prompts can unlock innovative uses for AI.
-Ethical Use: Thoughtful prompts help guide AI to produce responsible and unbiased content

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: “Write about climate change.”
Improved Prompt: “Describe the impact of climate change on polar ice caps and how this affects global sea levels.”
Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
The improved prompt is more effective because it directs the AI to provide detailed information on a specific topic within climate change, leading to a more relevant and useful answer. E.g.
1.	Specificity: The vague prompt is too broad, leading to a general discussion that may cover many unrelated topics. The improved prompt specifies the focus on polar ice caps and their connection to global sea levels, narrowing the scope and guiding the AI toward a more targeted response.
2.	Relevance: By directing the AI to discuss the relationship between polar ice caps and sea levels, the improved prompt ensures that the response will be relevant to a specific aspect of climate change, rather than a generic overview.
3.	Conciseness: The improved prompt clearly communicates what is required without unnecessary information, making it easier for the AI to generate a focused and informative response.
